in this repo we are going to talk about servers and their peculiarities

## What are?

In computing, a server is software or a computer, with a centralized computing system that provides services to a network of computers, called a client. These services can be of different natures, such as files and electronic mail.

# Types

- Application server or application server:
Used to run corporate applications and serve several workstations simultaneously, application servers generally need their processing power to run programs that cannot be executed only on a workstation.

Thus, several users would gain one or more corporate applications running on servers without impairing their local processing, keeping the respective databases always centralized, updated and stored in storages.

- File Server:
File servers are systems for storing and sharing a large amount of information between equipment and users, maintaining centralized management.

Strictly speaking, any computer can be configured as a file server, but equipment for this purpose, such as NAS storages, performs this function much better.

- Database server:
Some equipment is configured to boost and give efficiency, in a dedicated way, to the processing and transfer of data between the other computational systems of the IT infrastructure, such as some application servers and storages.

These computers are also known as database servers and typically provide a performance-appropriate environment for installing and processing databases that receive a large number of requests.

- Media server:
Also known as media servers, these devices can transmit audio or video content via the internet, through a process known as streaming. Netflix, Amazon Prime, Youtube and other content companies are examples of hard users of this type of technology.

Thanks to the DLNA protocol, home storage systems can also be considered media servers, as they can centralize and share content over local networks with other equipment such as TVs and audio systems.

- Email server:
Email servers are devices configured to store and transfer emails over local networks or the Internet.

 - Backup server:
Backup server is a type of equipment that combines hardware and software technologies to enable safe copying and provide services for recovering data from other computing devices.

Also known as a backup server, a backup server provides the storage capacity and communication channels needed to back up, maintain and manage the copying of files, applications and/or databases from other systems within the IT infrastructure.

- FTP server:
Server that, through a TCP/IP network, allows download and upload of files via connection with FTP protocol (File Transfer Protocol).

Widely used in a cloud environment, this type of server is aimed at storing and exchanging files, allowing control of transfers carried out and authentication by login and password, providing a secure environment for exchanging information between computers.

- Proxy Server:
Acting as a mediator between requests from client computers that seek resources from other servers, such as files, web pages and other services, the proxy server filters requests and determines how they should be handled.

This server is, for example, an intermediary between access made by a workstation to a web server, checking if there is any recent recorded access (cache), filtering and managing each request and thus improving the performance and security of the system.

- Web server:
As the name says, this is a type of server that provides services to run applications and make content available via the internet (cloud).

A web server can be accessed through browser programs such as Internet Explorer, Google Chrome or Safari, via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

Most web servers use robust systems such as Apache, based on Linux and freely distributed, mainly due to security and the large number of tools available for creating, managing and publishing websites.
